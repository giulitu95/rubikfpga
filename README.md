# Rubik FPGA - WORK IN PROGRESS!
The project is work in progress, in a pre alpha state.
We have the objective to design a machine based on a FPGA that solves the Rubik's Cube.

# Software
At this moment we're making a guideline program in Visual C++ that solves the cube for evalutate the complexity of the machine 
and how to design it on an FPGA using VHDL. 

# Hardware
We have only some ideas about it. It will be based on a Xilinx or Altera FPGA.
It use six stepper motors (one for face) controlled by an Allegro A4988 stepper motor controller.
Circuits will coming soon.
